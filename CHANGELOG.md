### Minor Changes

- 71b3fd8: Capture authenticated routes, compare against design hand-offs, and never
  mislabel a shot that wandered off the target.

  Three new capabilities, all project-agnostic; lookout still knows nothing about
  how any given app authenticates or which design tool drew its hand-off.

  `TargetDef.signIn?: (page) => Promise<void>` runs once per target before its
  routes are captured. The run shares one browser context, so whatever session
  the hook establishes persists across every route, form factor and scheme. A
  project supplies its own flow (clicking a demo-account button, walking an OAuth
  redirect, seeding a token); if the hook throws, the target's routes are skipped
  and recorded as a `signIn` failure rather than photographed signed-out under a
  signed-in label.

  `RouteDef.design?: string` points a route at a design hand-off image, resolved
  relative to the config file. The judge reads it alongside every shot of that
  route and compares one to one. The hand-off is a reference, not an authority:
  the rubric has lookout rule on each divergence by user impact, so it can find
  the build improved on the hand-off (contrast, touch targets, truncation) and
  decline to file it, find the hand-off right and the build drifted, or find both
  wrong and say what correct would be. A new `design-parity` category covers a
  divergence that is only a divergence. Rubric version is now 2, so cached
  judgements re-run.

  A new `off-origin` deterministic check compares each shot's final URL against
  its target's origin. An app that bounces to a login host or an SSO provider was
  previously captured and filed under the route that had been requested, so every
  finding on that shot silently described a different application. That is now a
  critical finding on the shot, ranked alongside `blank-shot` because both mean
  the pixels are not what the shot claims to be. Same-origin redirects stay
  silent.

### Patch Changes

- d6e7c70: Publish the package publicly. Scoped npm packages default to restricted
  access; `publishConfig.access: "public"` in package.json is the mechanism npm
  always honors, independent of the changesets-level `access` setting.
